# SeekAndDelete
SeekAndDelete was written as a simple to use tool for cleaning your computer.
This is why it is a PowerShell script, not a C++/C#/Python program.
There is no need to build or install anything, just download the file and use.

## Usage
Place SeekAndDelete.ps1 file into a directory where you want to look for duplicated files.
Be carefull, more files means longer execution time.

## Plans
Usage instructions for PowerShell scripts
Command line options for advanced users (root dir, compare options)
Find duplicated directories
